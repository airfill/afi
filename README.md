## AI-First Interface (AFI) SW solution for airfill 5G RAN

AFI is designed to be intuitive, agile, scalable, and easy-to-deploy,
which can connect to the existing monitoring infrastructure or enable the
development of a custom solution.

AFI offers deep visibility and extensive key performance indicators (KPIs),
providing simplified network operations, diagnostics, and performance
optimizations. This comprehensive network visibility empowers teams with
the insights and tools needed to efficiently manage 5G networks and drive
operational excellence.
